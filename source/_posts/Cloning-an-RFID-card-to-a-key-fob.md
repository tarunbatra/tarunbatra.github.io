## Story
I live in an apartment complex which requires use of an RFID card to access the complex. It is an additional piece that I need to keep in mind whenever I go out, so I decided to clone it to a key fob which can go with my other keys and I am used to it, from my previous apartment building.  I did not have any prior experience with access cards but I knew it was some kind of RFID card.

## Identify your card

To confirm this, I used a flashlight as detailed in [this blog][identify-rfid-blog]. I found out that the cardI had is a High Frequency(HF RFID) card which is commonly used in hotels and for event/transit tickets.
