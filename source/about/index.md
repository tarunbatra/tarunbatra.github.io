Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am a Software developer and have worked in domains like finance, logistics and gaming. I like to design and implement simple services which  come together to do complex things. Most of my experience is in Node.js and its ecosystem of tools. Other than tech, I like motorcycles and used to go on roaadtrips when I still had my motorcycle. These days I enjoy brewing and cooking.
