Other than working on my familiar tech-stack of Node.js and MongoDB, I picked up Terraform and GCP services like GCP Pub/Sub and GCP Cloud Tasks as well. I enjoy the challenges around K8s scaling and asynchronous task procesing here. Outside work, I am also active with Okta 4 Good and regularly volunteers at the GVFB food bank.
